				<h1>What is HTML?</h1>
			</header>

			<p>
				HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language;
				it is a markup language used to tell your browser how to structure the web pages you visit.
				It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wishes it to be.
				HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap,
				or mark up different parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way.
				The enclosing tags can make a bit of content into a hyperlink to link to another page on the web,
				italicize words, and so on.  For example, take the following line of content:
			</p>
			<br>
			<code class="code">
				My cat is very grumpy
			</code>
			<br>
			<p>
				If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it
				is a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph
				(<code>&#60;p&#62;</code>) element:
			</p>
			<br>
			<code class="code">
				&#60;p&#62;My cat is very grumpy&#60;/p&#62;
			</code>
		</section>

		<section class="main-section" id="Anatomy_of_an_HTML_element">

				<h1>Anatomy of an HTML element</h1>
			</header>

			<p>Let's explore our paragraph element a bit further:</p>

				alt="an image explaining about the paragraph element">
			<br>
			<p>The main parts of our element are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>The opening tag:</strong>
						This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p),
						wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where
						the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where
						the start of the paragraph is.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>The closing tag:</strong>
						This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a
						forward slash before the element name. This states where the
						element ends — in this case where the end of the paragraph is.
						Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error and
						can lead to strange results.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>The content:</strong>
						This is the content of the element, which in this case is just text.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>The element:</strong>
						The opening tag plus the closing tag plus the content equals the element.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section class="main-section" id="Attributes">
			<header>
				<h1>Attributes</h1>
			</header>

			<p>Elements can also have attributes, which look like this:</p>
			<br>
			<img
				src="https://media.prod.mdn.mozit.cloud/attachments/2014/11/14/9345/99516bbeb470af58b608d17bb30e53e6/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png"
				alt="an image explaining about attribute in a HTML element">
			<br>
			<p>
				Attributes contain extra information about the element that
				you don't want to appear in the actual content. In this case,
				the class attribute allows you to give the element an identifying name,
				that can be used later to target the element with style information and other things.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>An attribute should have:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						A space between it and the element name
						(or the previous attribute, if the element already
						has one or more attributes).
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						An attribute value, with opening and
						closing quote marks wrapped around it.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<header>
				<h1>Anatomy of an HTML document</h1>
			</header>

			<p>
				That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements,
				but they aren't very useful on their own. Now we'll look
				at how individual elements are combined to form an entire HTML page:
			</p>
			<br>
			<pre>
				<code class="code">
&#60;!DOCTYPE html >
&#60;html>
&#60;head>
	&#60;meta charset="utf-8">
	&#60;title>My test page</title>
&#60;/head>
&#60;body>
	&#60;p>This is my page&#60;/p>
&#60;/body>
&#60;/html>
				</code>
			</pre>
			<br>
			<p>Here we have:</p>
			<br>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						&#60;!DOCTYPE html>: The doctype. In the mists of time, when HTML was young
						(about 1991/2), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules
						that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML, which could
						mean automatic error checking and other useful things. They used to look
						something like this:
					</p>
					<br>
					<pre>
						<code class="code">
&#60;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
						</code>
					</pre>
					<br>
					<p>
						However, these days no one really cares about them, and they are
						really just a historical artifact that needs to be included for
						everything to work right. &#60;!DOCTYPE html> is the shortest string
						of characters that counts as a valid doctype; that's all you really
						need to know.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</section>

		<section class="main-section" id="HTML_comments">
			<header>
				<h1>HTML comments</h1>
			</header>

			<p>
				In HTML, as with most programming languages, there is a
				mechanism available to write comments in the code — comments are
				ignored by the browser and are invisible to the user, and their purpose
				is to allow you to include comments in the code to say how your code works,
				what the different parts of the code do, and so on. This can be very useful
				if you return to a code base that you've not worked on for a long time, and
				can't remember what you did — or if you hand your code over for someone else to work on.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				To turn a section of HTML content into a comment,
				you need to wrap it in the special markers
				<code>&#60;!--</code> and <code>--></code> , for example:
			</p>
			<br>
			<code class="code">
<p>I'm not inside a comment</p>
<br>
&#60;!-- &#60;p>I am!&#60;/p> -->
			</code>
